I want to download it myself for interest but I have no idea what to do. I've tried to do my research, using terminal or downloading python, but I have no idea what I'm doing. I was able to download it but as soon as I closed terminal it stopped working. For context, I am using MacOS. I am sorry if this is a dumb question but I truly do not know which tutorials to use as they are all different and something always ends up wrong. Thank you!",

        "content": "I'm currently looking into Jupyter to see if it can help me better organize my R stuff and make things \"more interactive.\" I'm currently only using vim to write my scripts and the standard RGui.exe to run and debug them. I have hundreds of scripts, most of them read and combine stuff from multiple database, do something with the data, and spit out a table or PDF file.\nThis way of working has served me fairly well, although it seems a bit outdated. Also I'm hoping that mixing R and markdown will entice better documentation. I don't really know what Jupyter is, but people really seem to like it and I want to see where it guides me. I've installed Jupyter and did a few starting exercises. But already I'm running into my first obstacle: Many of my scripts rely on some common data loading routine that is too small and specialized to put into a proper package, but too large to copy-and-paste each time. So I simply source() that from within the directory where my script is. But Jupyter can't find those \"local\" R files because it doesn't know where they are, even when I start the server from within that directory.\nThat's my first roadblock. How do I solve that?",

I am using R and the fixest package to do some fixed effects regressions with Industry and Year fixed effects. There are different models that I gather then together with etable. For simplicity lets assume that it is only one.\nreg_fe = feols( y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 | Industry+Year, df)\nmtable_de = etable(reg_fe_model1, reg_fe_model2.5, reg_fe_model2, reg_fe_model2.1, cluster = \"id\", signif.code = c(\"***\" = 0.01, \"**\" = 0.05, \"*\" = 0.1), fitstat=~.+n+f+f.p+wf+wf.p+ar2+war2+wald+wald.p, se.below = TRUE )\nNow my question. The above code produces the cluster standard errors by firm. Are those standard errors ALSO robust?\nAlternatively, I can use\nreg_fe = feols( y ~ x1 + x2 + x3 | Industry+Year, df, vcoc = \"hetero\")\nRead more",

I have decided to go with a monolith for now with a clean architecture maintaining separate repository, service and transport layer. To clarify\nrepository handles all the database related operations.\nservice acts as a middleware performing any logic operations on a repository to achieve a set of task.\ntransport stores the type of transport layer methods in which for now there is http that has all controllers, routes.\nSo I am using gorm with PostgreSQL and the issue is I have two different repositories one for managing videos and the other is thumbnails. The issue is I want to create the thumbnail and simalteneously update the video status in a transaction. So I am confused here on what can be a good practice here -\nI can directly use the video table in the thumbnail repository but I don't know if that is a good practice.\nThe second is I can leak it to the service layer but that breaks the abstraction of the repository layer.\nIf you guys have any other solution can you recommend me.\nThanks for the help in advance :)",

As the name suggests, Go Go Proxy is an API proxy that includes JWT-based authentication, response caching via Redis, and rate limiting.\nHow does it work? Go Go Proxy receives an incoming request and forwards it (copying both the body and headers) to the URL specified as a query parameter, while adding the required API key. This makes it easy to add an extra security layer to public API calls — especially thanks to rate limiting and caching, which can help reduce costs when using paid services.\nIt also supports optional checks on Origin, Referer, and includes a heuristic control to verify that requests are likely being made by a browser via JavaScript.\nYou can find all the documentation here: https://github.com/luca-martinelli-09/go-go-proxy",
